## Licence:

This package is released under the [**MIT Licence**](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This means you're free to use it at no cost in any of your commercial or non-commercial projects. If you want to contribute to this project, great! Please read below for instructions on how to get involved.

## Contributing:

Getting started is easy with the [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)  VM. Simply run `vagrant up` and then `vagrant ssh`.

Please follow the following guidelines when writing new code:

1. Nobody likes being wet. Stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
1. Follow the [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule). Litterers will be punished!
1. All source code is written in ES6 and transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). No ES5 code, please!
1. Test your code with the `npm test` command and check for coverage using `npm run coverage`. If possible, aim for 100% coverage - the Travis/Coveralls build process will fail if the overall value falls below 80%.
1. Don't be [this guy](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/). Meaningless commit messages make me sad :(
